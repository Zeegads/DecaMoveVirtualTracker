# DecaMoveVirtualTracker

Creates a virtual "vive" hip tracker that lets you rotate your hips with the decamove.

## How to use
* Unzip and run driver_install.bat
* A new tracker will show up in SteamVR and the position will update while the DecaMove is connected
* If you want to move the folder, uninstall the driver, move and then reinstall the driver

## Requirements:
* DecaHub installed (uses install_driver.exe and uninstall_driver.exe)

## Limitations 
* Disables Decamove's directional input for movement.
* Just hip rotation, no hip sway left to right or front to back.

## Tested Applications:
* VRChat
* Beatsaber(Set the virtual tracker to waist in steam VR Menu)
